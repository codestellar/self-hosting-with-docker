# Pointing a domain to AWS Lightsail

* You can add an A record in your Domain DNS panel pointing to the static ip of AWS
* Or you can use AWS to manage DNS records
* AWS Lightsail allows you creating 3 DNS zones
* You can use [AWS Route 53](https://aws.amazon.com/route53/) service to manage more domains

I am using AWS Lightsail DNS Zone to manage DNS records

* Create DNS Zone
* AWS gives you name servers
* Add the nameservers in your domain panel
